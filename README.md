Compare cost between cars over the number of miles driven using US EIA data

# EIA
The U.S. Energy Information Administration has publicly available data on [fuel effiency](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.shtml) as well as [gas prices]() and [electricity prices]() throughout the United States. Using this data, we can determine the cost of using a car according to the number of miles one drives. This comparison can be helpful in purchase decisions, as well as showing the energy and economic efficiency of electric cars over gas-powered cars.
